# How to fetch scores

It is not guaranteed that your scores and/or profile is immediately accessible.


If this is your first time visiting, or suspect you are missing scores, please follow these steps:


1. Join the osu!alternative Discord
2. Head over to the #info channel and scroll down to the TLDR section (but reading the rest is recommended)
3. Step 1 & 2 are most important for score fetching.
4. If you already fetched in the past, you can request @respektive to take you off the list in order to refetch (a good thing to do when osu! changes important scoring elements, like how grades are calculated)
5. Once you have completed all the steps and confirmed your scores are up to date, your profile should be fully functional and complete.
